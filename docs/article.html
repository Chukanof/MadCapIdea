<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This article is the culmination of stuff I have been doing on the train on my 
way to work over 6 months. I have written quite a lot of blog posts on this 
already which you can read about on the projects home page on my blog :

https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/madcap-idea/</a> </p>
<p>There are 13 blog posts there, but I thought it would be good to also have 
this overall article which covers all of it, as the blog posts are more a 
sequence of events that I went through which talk about the peices in great 
detail as I went through them</p>
<p>For example these were the blog posts</p>

<h2>So just exactly what is it that I was/am talking about?</h2>
<p>In essence I want to write a very (pardon the pun) but uber simple “uber” 
type app. Where there are the following funtional requirements<br><br></p>
<ul>
	<li>There should be a web interface that a client can use. Clients may be a 
	“driver” or a “pickup client” requireing a delivery</li>
	<li>There should be a web interface that a “pickup client” can use, that 
	shows a “pickup client” location on a map, which the “pickup client” choses.</li>
	<li>The “pickup client” may request a pickup job, in which case “drivers” 
	that are in the area bid for a job.</li>
	<li>The “pickup client” location should be visible to a “driver” on a map</li>
	<li>A “driver” may bid for a “pickup client” job, and the bidding 
	“driver(s)” location should be visible to the “pickup client”.</li>
	<li>The acceptance of the bidding “driver” is down to the “pickup client”</li>
	<li>Once a “pickup client” accepts a “driver” ONLY the assigned “driver(s)” 
	current map position will be shown to the “pickup client”</li>
	<li>When a “pickup client” is happy that they have been picked up by a 
	“driver”, the “pickup client” may rate the driver from 1-10, and the 
	“driver” may also rate the “pickup client” from 1-10.</li>
	<li>The rating should only be available once a “pickup client” has marked a 
	job as “completed”</li>
	<li>A “driver” or a “pickup client” should ALWAYS be able to view their 
	previous ratings. </li>
</ul>
<p>Whilst this may sound child’s play to a lot of you (me included if I 
stuck to using simply CRUD operations), I just want to point out that this 
app is meant as a learning experience so I will not be using a simple 
SignalR Hub, and a couple of database tables.</p>
<p>I have written this proj using a completely different set of technologies from the norm. Some 
of the technology choices could easily scale to hundreds of thousands of 
requests per second (Kafka has your back here)<br><br><strong>TECNHOLOGIES 
INVOLVED</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>WebPack</li>
	<li>React Router</li>
	<li>TypeScript</li>
	<li>Babel.js</li>
	<li>Akka</li>
	<li>Scala</li>
	<li>Play (Scala Http Stack)</li>
	<li>MySql</li>
	<li>SBT</li>
	<li>Kafka</li>
	<li>Kafka Streams</li>
</ul>

<h1>Where is the code?</h1>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<h1>How do I run all this stuff?</h1>
<h1>Known issues</h1>
<p>The following are known issues</p>
<ul>
	<li>One a driver an passenger become paired, the position updates from 
	either are no longer reflected. I am sure this would boil down to a single 
	JavaScript method that needs updating in the ViewJob.tsx file. However I 
	just kind of got to the end of a very long road (I have been writing about 
	this on an off for 6 months of train rides) and was just happy that I got 
	99% of the stuff done, and just thought you know what, the app as it is now 
	demonstrates everything I set out to do, so I&#39;m ok with one known issue</li>
</ul>
<h1>Some basics</h1>
<p>Before we dive into the actual code for the app (and there is quite a bit of 
it), I just thought it may be good to go over some of the individual building 
blocks that make up the app as a whole first, the next few sections will do 
that.</p>
<h1>What is Kafka?</h1>
<h1>What is Kafka Streams?</h1>
<h1>What is Play</h1>
<h1>What is WebPack</h1>
<h1>What is React</h1>

<h1>Registration workflow</h1>
<h1>Login workflow</h1>
<h1>CreateJob workflow</h1>
<h1>ViewJob workflow</h1>
<h1>ViewRating workflow</h1>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This was certainly a challenging thing to write, and I am honestly pleased that I got it done, I have had a really good time writing this. And it has been a great project for self improvement, and 
I would recommend this type of thing as a great use of time. Go on find yourself 
a pet project</p>
